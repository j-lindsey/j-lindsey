I have a lifelong passion for understanding and solving problems.  I am driven to dig in and understand what is going wrong and loves when the lightbulb goes off and I find the solution or the missing piece.  I love collaborating with others to bring ideas to life.  When I am interested in a subject I needs to learn everything I can about it.  I just finished a full stack development course and final work integrated project and am looking to put my new skills to use.
